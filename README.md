# Star Rendering OpenGL Game

This is a passion project for me to recreate some of the arcade style asteroid games using OpenGL and C++. While unfinished, some of the notable features are 
- Planet mesh generation
- Star chunking
- Instanced rendering (renders hundrends of thousands of star objects)
- Versatile player controls
